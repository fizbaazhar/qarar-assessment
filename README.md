- Intuitive navigation between sections

#### 3. **Task Management**
- Drag-and-drop task reordering
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Status tracking and progress visualization
- Persistent task state with localStorage

#### 4. **Notification System**
- Real-time notification display

- Form validation and error handling
- Data persistence across sessions
- Integration with authentication system

### Component Architecture
- **Reusable Components**: Button, Input, Card, Modal components
- **Layout Components**: MainLayout, AuthLayout for consistent page structure
- **Feature Components**: DashboardCard, TasksCard, NotificationCard
- **Page Components**: Dashboard, Login, Signup, Profile, Tasks, Notifications

### State Management Strategy
- **Redux Slices**: Separate slices for auth, profile, tasks, and notifications
- **Local State**: Component-level state for forms and UI interactions
- **Persistence**: localStorage for user preferences and data persistence

## 🤔 Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Assumptions Made

#### 1. **User Experience**
- Users prefer a modern, card-based interface over traditional table layouts
- Drag-and-drop functionality is intuitive for task management
- Real-time notification updates are expected
- Form validation should be immediate and user-friendly

#### 2. **Technical Decisions**
- React 19 provides better performance and developer experience
- Redux Toolkit simplifies state management complexity
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development and consistency
- Client-side routing is sufficient for this application scope

#### 3. **Data Management**
- localStorage is adequate for data persistence in this assessment
- No backend API is required for demonstration purposes
- Mock data generation provides realistic testing scenarios

### Trade-offs Considered

#### 1. **Performance vs. Features**
- **Chosen**: Rich UI with animations and interactions
- **Trade-off**: Slightly larger bundle size, but better user experience
- **Justification**: Modern applications should feel responsive and engaging

#### 2. **Simplicity vs. Scalability**
- **Chosen**: Redux Toolkit for state management
- **Trade-off**: More boilerplate code initially
- **Justification**: Provides predictable state management and debugging tools

#### 3. **Development Speed vs. Code Quality**
- **Chosen**: Comprehensive testing suite
- **Trade-off**: More time spent on test development
- **Justification**: Ensures reliability and maintainability

#### 4. **Design Flexibility vs. Consistency**
- **Chosen**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Trade-off**: HTML can become verbose
- **Justification**: Ensures design consistency and rapid development

#### 5. **Feature Completeness vs. Assessment Scope**
- **Chosen**: Focus on core features with polish
- **Trade-off**: Some advanced features not implemented
- **Justification**: Demonstrates quality over quantity

### Technical Limitations

#### 1. **Data Persistence**
- Uses localStorage instead of a real database
- Data is lost when browser storage is cleared
- No data synchronization across devices

#### 2. **Authentication**
- Mock authentication without real backend
- No password hashing or security measures
- Session management is basic

#### 3. **Real-time Features**
- Notifications are simulated, not real-time
- No WebSocket connections or server-sent events
- Updates require manual refresh

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **85 tests** covering all major features
- **React Testing Library** for user-centric testing
- **Snapshot tests** for component consistency
- **Integration tests** for user workflows
- **Redux tests** for state management

### Testing Principles
- Test user behavior, not implementation details
- Focus on accessibility and user interactions
- Maintain test readability and maintainability
- Use meaningful test descriptions

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue (#3B82F6) for main actions and branding
- **Secondary**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds
- **Success**: Green for positive actions
- **Warning**: Yellow for caution states
- **Error**: Red for error states

### Typography
- **Headings**: Bold, large text for hierarchy
- **Body**: Regular weight for readability
- **Labels**: Small, bold text for form elements

### Spacing & Layout
- **Consistent spacing** using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Card-based layout** for content organization
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Backend Integration**: Real API endpoints and database
2. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections for live updates
3. **Advanced Authentication**: OAuth, JWT tokens, password reset
4. **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for analytics
5. **Offline Support**: Service workers for offline functionality
6. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
7. **Advanced Testing**: E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright

### Scalability Considerations
- Component library for design consistency
- API abstraction layer for backend integration
- State management patterns for complex features
